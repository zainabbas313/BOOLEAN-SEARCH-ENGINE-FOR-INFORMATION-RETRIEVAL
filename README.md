# BOOLEAN SEARCH ENGINE FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

## Introduction

This project implements a boolean search engine for information retrieval. The search engine allows users to perform boolean queries on a collection of documents to retrieve relevant information. It utilizes various text analysis techniques and data structures for efficient searching.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- nltk
- os
- string
- nltk.corpus.words
- nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize
- nltk.stem.porter.PorterStemmer
- nltk.corpus.wordnet
- math

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  bash
   git clone https://github.com/zainabbas313/BOOLEAN-SEARCH-ENGINE-FOR-INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL.git




## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed as mentioned in the requirements.
2. Place your text documents in a directory.
3. Run the `search_engine.py` script, providing the directory path containing your documents.
4. Follow the instructions to enter your boolean query.
5. The search engine will retrieve relevant documents based on your query.

## Examples

- Example query: `apple AND orange`
  - This query will retrieve documents containing both "apple" and "orange".

- Example query: `cat AND NOT dog`
  - This query will retrieve documents containing "cat" but not "dog".
